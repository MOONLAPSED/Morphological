## Requirements:
 - Windows 11
 - `OptionalFeatures.exe`:
    - "Virtual Machine Platform", "Windows Hypervisor Platform", "Windows Sandbox", "Windows Subsystem for Linux" must be enabled.
 - Run as administrator

## Directions:
 - Open the `/platform/` directory, and assuming it has a custom icon (for 'Windows Sandbox, implying you have enabled it in the Optional Features), double-click the `sandbox_config.wsb` file to start the virtual machine.
 - You will see a command prompt open automatically, you should see that it does something for some time while you have no option to input.
 - Finally, once you are given a prompt to type, type in `.\invoke_setup.bat` exactly like this without the ticks.
 - You have entered into my customized Windows11 native Python+VSCode sandbox; say yes when VSCode gives you a popup about if you want to install the Python extension, and then you can start coding in the sandbox.
